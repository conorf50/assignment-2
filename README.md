##Project Outline:
####What does it do?
This is a (basic) movie recommendation system writtem in Java 8, that lists users, the movies they've rated and the movies themselves.
The code has been documented with Eclipse's built in Javadoc generator.

####Outline:
The programme runs in Eclipse as a command line application. The user can interact with the application through the CLI.

####How to use:
To add a user you need their fist and last names, their age, their gender and their occupation.
